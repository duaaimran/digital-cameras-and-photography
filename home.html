            Revolutionizing the Way We Take Pictures

                In an age where everyone has a digital camera in their back pocket, we cannot fathom 
                a world where photography is more complicated than a simple click or press of a button. 
                However, about 60 years ago, photography was a lot more complicated, requiring a tedious 
                development process. 
                <br><br>
                Film photography was the main mode of capturing memories back in the 1960s. Where nowadays 
                we don’t think twice about taking a picture, with film photography every photo is carefully 
                and thoughtfully taken, making it a fulfilling hobby for many.
                <br><br>
                After the introduction of the Sony Mavica and Canon’s RC-701, handheld cameras began to 
                dominate the photography market. However, due to their cost and poor image quality, they 
                were mostly used by newspapers to cover events like the 1984 Olympics. As technology developed 
                over the years, so did cameras, leading to the high quality tools we have today.

            Point and Shoot Digital Cameras
        </h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 1.5em;">
                The first point and shoot digital camera was released in 1990, the Dycam Model 1. 
                With digital picture storage, the Dycam could connect directly to a PC for downloads, which 
                revolutionized the way people took and stored photos. By the mid-90’s, even Apple entered 
                the digital market with the Apple QuickTake 100 in 1994. Manufactured by Kodak, the QuickTake 
                was the first colour digital camera for under $1,000, storing 8 images in its internal memory 
                with a 640x480-pixel CCD. Further development would include the LCD screens, sound, webcams 
                and compact cameras.
                <br><br>
                Vintage Y2K cameras like the point and shoot shown on the right are again becoming popular with Gen Z,
                due to their retro aesthetic. The ability of the point and shoot to take high-quality photos with minimal 
                effort has made it a popular tool for Gen Z photographers, who are looking for a more authentic and 
                nostalgic feel to their photos.

                Digital photography has become a popular hobby for many people, with the rise of social media 
                platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The ability to take high-quality photos with a simple click 
                has made photography more accessible to the general public. 
                <br><br>
                The rise of digital photography has also led to the rise of digital influencers, who use their 
                photography skills to create content for their followers. Many influencers use digital photography 
                as a way to express themselves and connect with their audience. 
                <br><br>
                With the rise of digital photography, many people have turned to photography as a way to relax and 
                unwind. The act of taking photos can be a therapeutic experience, allowing people to express themselves 
                and capture the beauty of the world around them.
